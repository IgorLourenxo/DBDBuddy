# DBD-Buddy
Dead by Daylight Buddy is a tool for the game's players to help them decide on builds to play and share the ones they create!

You can find it online in www.deadbydaylightbuddy.com.

It was my **first ever!** web project using only raw PHP. It was a blast to make at the time for a school final project, and I'm greatly proud that it served it's purpose for some people besides myself!
	Unfortunately, I have since decided to not update it any further as I don't relate to this project anymore.
